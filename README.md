# TODO Ng

This is a simple TODO app made with:

* Angular 13
* UIKit
* NgRx

## Setup

You can run the application only with Docker installed on your machine with the command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Or, if you want to improve and develop, you are going to need installed:

* [Node 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular CLI 13.2.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli)
* [Json server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

The application runs with a fake backend (json-server), is a tool that easily helps you
to simulate REST API calls.
